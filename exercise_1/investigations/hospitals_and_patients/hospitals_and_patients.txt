Question:
Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

Methodology:
For this, I correlated the results of the best_states and variability queries with the average
HCAHPS score.

Results:

Average score vs. HCAHPS: 0.27262944074435486
Standard deviation vs. HCAHPS: 0.016954508936351448

Interpretation:
Here we see a small but decent correlation with our average score metric vs. the HCAHPS results.
We do not see any correlation with variability and the HCAHPS results, which is to be expected.

While we do not have data readily available, logically speaking, there could be a variety of factors in play which 
could cause our score to correlate with the HCAHPS results. For instance, individuals and caretakers might be 
likely favor hospitals which specialize in certain procedures if given the chance. Likewise, generally well-run 
hospitals with  an emphasis on customer experience might tend to have better across-the-board scores on average, 
which could explain the correlation.
