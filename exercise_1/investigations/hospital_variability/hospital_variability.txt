Question:
Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

Methodology:
For this question, I aggregated the procedure score's table by measure ID (standard deviation). For clarity,
I then revealed the measure name/description by joining the resulting table with the measures table.

Results:

Abdomen CT Use of Contrast Material	OP_10	11.608368735017418
MRI Lumbar Spine for Low Back Pain	OP_8	7.469737305531352
Thorax CT Use of Contrast Material	OP_11	6.354985606889158
Mammography Follow-up Rates		OP_9	5.037098962341643
Outpatients who got cardiac imaging stress tests before low-risk outpatient surgery	OP_13	2.1267656098206222
Outpatients with brain CT scans who got a sinus CT scan at the same time		OP_14	1.8843956765542667
Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Mortality Rate		MORT_30_PN	1.6990103887207297
Death rate for stroke patients			MORT_30_STK	1.6341955994579136
Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Readmission Rate	READM_30_HF	1.5775597422518515
Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Mortality Rate	MORT_30_HF	1.4220139931224614

Interpretation:
Primarily, the largest difference between hospitals is the degree of imaging employed. After this, we find a 
large degree of variability in mortality rates for pneumonia and heart failure.

Why we are seeing this variation is not necessarily directly  tied to quality
of care. Influences not immediately apparent in the data set such as access to
imaging technology or local environmental influences could be the source of
a some variance. More data is required to determine why we are seeing this
variation in procedures between hospitals.
