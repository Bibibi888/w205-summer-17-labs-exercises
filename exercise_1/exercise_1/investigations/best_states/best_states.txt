Question:
What states are models of high-quality care?

Methodology:
For this, we essentially took the query from best_hospitals and joined it with the hospitals table to retrieve state data.
Using this, we aggregated by state on top of the hospitals results to get overall state results.

Results:

NJ	0.5424622418608398
MD	0.5726791093692771
CT	0.6564986397539416
RI	0.6794075452372815
NH	0.725862126046745
VA	0.7294018284045526
DC	0.7491428628147321
FL	0.8416171500991299
HI	0.8640036144133342
ME	0.8742785942035245

Interpretation:
Typically, we're seeing north eastern states as models for hospital quality with New Jersey, Maryland and Connecticut ranking
as the best performing states. These are quite interesting findings- we see an extremely strong regional trend for the north east.
Why this is the case is not immediately clear. It could be due to education levels, income, urbanisation, common regional policies,
or a myriad of other factors. More investigation is required to concretely determine why the north eastern states typically
outperform other states and other regions of the country.
