Question:
  Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

Methodology:
For this, I essentially correlated the results of the best_states and variability queries with the average
HCAHPS score.

Results:

Average score vs. HCAHPS: 0.27262944074435486
Standard deviation vs. HCAHPS: 0.016954508936351448

Interpretation:
Here we see a small but decent correlation with our average custom metric vs. the hcahps results.
We do not see any correlation with variability and the hcahps results, which is to be expected.

While we do not have data readily available, logically speaking, people would be likely favor
hospitals which specialize in certain procedures if given the chance. This could be a factor in 
why the correlation exists. Likewise, well run hospitals might tend to have better scores across the board
on average, which could explain the correlation.
