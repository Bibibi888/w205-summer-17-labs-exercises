Question:
What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have
the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

Methodology:
In order to solve this question, I first devised a list of critical measures which are within scope and suitable for 
this assignment. The data sources span across three CSV files:
	
	- Complications (Hospital)
	- Infections (Hospital)
	- Readmissions and Deaths (Hospital)
	- Outpatient Imaging (Hospital)

From the above CSV files, I created a list of measures which appeared to be properly standardized or otherwise applicable
to this assignment.

Originally, I had planned to include timely and effective care. However, due to specific issues with the data set, 
there was a real risk of improperly transforming the data and introducing unnecessary error.

From here, I aggregated each measure's score by hospital and divided the resulting average by the number of measures
the hospital participated in. As a side effect, this methodology will mildly punish hospitals which did not participate in a large
number of measures.

Results:

Interpretation:
With the exception of Mayhill Hospital, all of the listed hospitals appear to be fairly large hospitals, many of which touting a 
variety of awards.
